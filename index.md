# My Research
We have detected thousands of exoplanets with a huge diversity in terms of intrinsic characteristics (mass, size, composition, atmosphere, ...) and orbital radii. At the same time, for instance using the powerful (sub-)mm interferometer ALMA, we can detect and spatially resolve hundreds of protoplanetary discs, which we think are the birth places of these planets. While the observed discs also exhibit a wide variety of characteristics, including substructures like gaps, rings, and spirals, which could be caused by embedded planents, the exact connection between planetary systems and their progentior discs is yet to be found. In particular, most exoplanets are detected close to their host star, well within 10au. Observationally, however, we've mostly focused on the outer, colder disc outside of 10au. My research focuses instead on these inner disc regions, looking at emission at shorter wavelengths in the infrared, which trace gas at a few hundreds to thousands of Kelvin. To achieve this, we can use ground based instruments such as the Very Large Telescope (VLT), or the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), as well as space based instruments like JWST.
